This project presents a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for real-time facial emotion recognition, developed as a semester project for the 4th semester course “Introduction to Data Science” in the BS Data Science program. The report is submitted to Mr. Muhammad Tariq Rasheed. The model is designed for integration with the Android application VIBECHECK, and classifies grayscale facial images into one of six emotions: angry, disgust, fear, happy, neutral, or sad.

VIBECHECK’s core use case is to automatically capture group photos ("autosnap") when all participants share the same emotional "vibe". This helps users take more balanced, meaningful group photos by leveraging real-time emotion detection. The model is optimized for mobile deployment using TensorFlow Lite.
While primarily built for VIBECHECK, the solution can be adapted for other emotion-aware applications such as smart cameras, social robots, or interactive mobile apps.
